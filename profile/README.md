## About us
We are a team of engineers with extensive experience across various multinational corporations, including leading roles in telecommunications (Telefónica), technology suppliers (Nokia), and enterprise users (Inditex), as well as university research and innovation departments (University of Vigo, Polytechnic University of Cartagena). 

Driven by our collective expertise, we have embarked on a new venture—launching our own startup. This was made possible thanks to the broad research and developments carried out at the University of Vigo, and the financial support from the Government of Galicia.

We believe that Edge Computing will experience significant growth in the coming years, particularly for applications that demand high performance (low latency, minimal jitter) or that aim to reduce operational costs. There is a gap in the market for software solutions aimed to manage applications on the edge, across a broad geography. 

Our edge computing platform focused on scalability, hypervisor agnosticism, convergence, flexibility, and efficiency. Additionally, we are incorporating standard interfaces for integration with 5G networks and ensuring compatibility with various virtualization technologies, including virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, among others.
